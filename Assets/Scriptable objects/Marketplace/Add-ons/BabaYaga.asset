  summary: downloadable content
  description: Deep in the wilds of Siberia, there is a forbidden forest that no man
    will enter, where a Soviet expedition vanished without a trace. Lara enters the
    Wicked Vale in search of a missing man, but what she finds is a nightmare that
    she cannot explain. Is the witch, Baba Yaga, truly haunting the forbidden forest?
    Or is there more to the legend? Featuring hours of new gameplay, this adventure
    expands the story of the main campaign with Lara facing deadly new adversaries,
    exploring a new puzzle-filled tomb, and solving a decades old mystery, all culminating
    in a showdown with an ancient and mythic evil. Includes a new outfit, and a new
    bow.
