  summary: downloadable content
  description: Alone and in the wild, Lara must scrounge, scavenge, craft and survive
    the harsh elements by day, as well as lethal threats from enemies, both man and
    beast, by night. This is her ultimate woman-versus-wild test to push the limits
    of how long she can survive on her own in sprawling, unforgiving landscapes. Fire
    takes fuel, cold kills the unprepared, food restores health, but everything must
    be caught, collected, or crafted. You start with nothing and must find everything.
    Challenge friends to your longest survival run and battle to the top of the leaderboards
    for the title of Ultimate Survivor. Includes a new outfit and weapon.
